I know, love, it is such a funny thing
A mystery allure
Gotta get to know you more
'Cause I, I can feel a real connection
A supernatural attraction, ah
I got the feels for you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You have stolen my heart, oh, yeah
Never let it go, oh, oh, no
Never let it go, oh, oh, oh
Lightning straight to my heart, oh, yeah
I got all the feels for sure
Yeah, I got all the feels for ya
